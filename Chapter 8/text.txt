The White House is the home and main workplace of the President of the United States.
The house was designed by Irish-born James Hoban.
It is at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW in Washington, D.C..
The building was built between 1792 and 1800 out of white-painted sandstone from Aquia Creek in Virginia.
It was designed in the Neoclassical style. It has been the home of every U.S. President since John Adams.
When Thomas Jefferson moved into the house in 1801, he (with architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe) expanded the building outward.
They made two colonnades that were meant to hide stables and storage.
It was originally called the Executive Mansion before being renamed the White House by President Theodore Roosevelt.
In 1814, during the War of 1812, the mansion was set on fire by the British Army in the Burning of Washington.
The fire destroyed the inside of the house and charred much of the outside.
Reconstruction began almost immediately. President James Monroe moved into the partially reconstructed house in October 1817.
Construction continued with the addition of the South Portico in 1824 and the North in 1829.
